# 🚀 Telegram Bot 24/7 Deployment Guide

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Your Telegram bot has been successfully migrated and configured for 24/7 operation with the following improvements:

### 🔧 What's Been Implemented

1. **Keep-Alive Server**: A health check server running on port 5000
2. **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint for UptimeRobot monitoring  
3. **Status Dashboard**: `/` endpoint showing bot statistics
4. **Threading Architecture**: Bot and web server run simultaneously
5. **Security Fixes**: Removed pytz dependencies, fixed import errors

### 🌐 Your Bot URLs

Once deployed, your bot will be accessible at:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/health`
- **Status Page**: `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/`

## 📋 UptimeRobot Setup (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Get Your Replit URL
1. Your running Replit will have a URL like: `https://workspace.your-username.repl.co`
2. Note this URL - you'll need it for UptimeRobot

### Step 2: Create UptimeRobot Account
1. Go to [https://uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's free!)
3. Verify your email address

### Step 3: Add Your Bot Monitor
1. Click **"+ Add New Monitor"**
2. **Monitor Type**: HTTP(s)
3. **Friendly Name**: "Telegram Bot - [Your Bot Name]"
4. **URL**: `https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/health`
5. **Monitoring Interval**: 5 minutes (free plan)
6. **Monitor Timeout**: 30 seconds
7. **HTTP Method**: GET
8. Click **"Create Monitor"**

### Step 4: Verify It's Working
1. Wait 5-10 minutes after creating the monitor
2. UptimeRobot should show your bot as "Up" (green)
3. Visit your health URL directly to see: `{"status": "healthy", "bot_status": "running"...}`

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **UptimeRobot** pings your `/health` endpoint every 5 minutes
2. **Replit** stays active because of the regular HTTP requests
3. **Your Bot** continues running 24/7 without interruption
4. **Health Server** responds with bot status and uptime

## 📊 Monitoring Your Bot

### Health Endpoint Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "bot_status": "running", 
  "uptime": "2h 15m",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-10T23:02:04.077431",
  "check_count": 27
}
```

### Status Dashboard:
Visit the root URL to see:
- Bot name and status
- Total uptime
- Health check count  
- Available endpoints

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Replit Plans:
- **Free Plan**: May still hibernate after extended inactivity
- **Hacker Plan**: Includes "Always On" feature for true 24/7 operation
- **UptimeRobot**: Helps but doesn't guarantee 100% uptime on free plans

### Best Practices:
1. **Monitor your UptimeRobot dashboard** for downtime alerts
2. **Check bot logs** in Replit console if issues occur
3. **Test your bot** regularly to ensure all commands work
4. **Keep your bot token secure** - never share it publicly

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

Test your setup:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/health

# Test status page  
curl https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/

# Test your bot in Telegram
/start
/help
/dice
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If UptimeRobot shows "Down":
1. Check your Replit console for errors
2. Verify the health endpoint returns HTTP 200
3. Ensure port 5000 is correctly bound
4. Restart your Replit if needed

### If Bot doesn't respond:
1. Check Telegram bot token is valid
2. Verify bot has proper permissions in your groups
3. Check console logs for Python errors
4. Test with simple commands like `/start`

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Bot responds to `/start` command in Telegram
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy"...}`
- [ ] UptimeRobot monitor shows "Up" status
- [ ] Status page shows correct uptime
- [ ] All bot commands work properly

Your Telegram bot is now ready for 24/7 operation! 🎉
